Each day I rise, though the weight is strong,
Moving forward even when the road feels wrong.
A trembling grip, but I still survive—
Barely holding on, yet choosing life.

Some nights I break in the quiet air,
Whispers of doubt tangled in despair.
But even cracked, my heart stays true—
Still fighting on, still pushing through.

And though the storms keep wearing me thin,
I gather strength from the battles I’m in.
For even the weary can learn to stand—
With shaky breath, but steady hands.

And though the storms try to pull me down,
I find small lights in the places I’ve found.
Hope may flicker, but it still survives—
Guiding my heart back into brighter skies.

And when the night feels heavier than before,
I drown in thoughts I can’t ignore.
A quiet ache no one can see—
A fading echo of who I used to be.
