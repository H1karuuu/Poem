Each day I rise, though the weight is strong,
Moving forward even when the road feels wrong.
A trembling grip, but I still survive—
Barely holding on, yet choosing life.

Some nights I break in the quiet air,
Whispers of doubt tangled in despair.
But even cracked, my heart stays true—
Still fighting on, still pushing through.
